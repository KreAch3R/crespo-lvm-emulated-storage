#LVM-provided emulated storage for the Nexus S (crespo)#

This is a way to make your Nexus S use an **internal emulated SDcard**, and mount it using **MTP** (just like the Nexus 4 and newer smartphones)! These are the necessary files changes inside the boot.img, recovery.img, and ROM's framework-res.apk to use logical partitioning on the Nexus S and a combined storage, with an emulated SDcard inside /data/, just like in Nexus 4 and beyond. This disables USB storage.
